									</a>
									<p>American Football is played in three basic phases: offense, defense and special teams. Each phase has 11 players on the field at a time, with players usually playing just one phase, though at younger levels you will see all three phases represented by one player. On offense, teams are attempting to score points, either in the form of a touchdown or a field goal. The defense is attempting to stop the offense from scoring by forcing the offense to punt, or force an offensive turnover. Special teams occur inbetween offensive and defensive possessions, and can often swing the momentum of a game by giving teams' better field position. </p>
									<p>The 11-man offensive unit has a few key parts:<br>
									-One Quarterback, responsible for leading the unit and passing the ball through the air <br>
									-Three Wideouts or Wide Recievers, responsible for running down field and catching the ball <br>
									-One Tight End, who acts a larger wide reciever who can go down field to catch, or stay and block opposing defenders <br>
									-One Running Back, responsible for taking handoffs and gaining yards on the ground <br>
									-Five offensive lineman [which include two guards, two tackles and a center], responsible for snapping the ball and then blocking opposing defenders<br><br>

									An offense can go with different formations with different amounts of players, which we will explain later, but this is just the base formation for the offense. Whatever formation is on the field is trying to eventually score. A touchdown, which occurs when a team gets into another team's endzone, is worth six points. Following a touchdown, teams can choose to kick a one point extra point or a try for a two point conversion. Teams can also try to kick a field goal which is worth three points. 
									<br><br>
									This is done by moving down the field and picking up first downs. A first down occurs after the offense picks up 10 yards, either through passing or rushing, and a new first down marker is placed 10 yards from where the offense picked up the old first down. An offense has four downs, or attempts, to pass this marker, or the other team's offense will get the ball where they were. Because of this, over 99.99% of offenses use a three-down system. If they have not picked up the first down after three tries, they will send out the special team unit to punt the ball away....
									</p>
									
									<p>The punting unit is one of many special teams jobs. Like offense, each special team unit will have 11 players, and players will often play on more than one unit. Kickoffs, field goals and punts are all handled by special teams. On kickoffs, one team kicks the ball to another team, who attempt to run the ball back. Players may be paid a few million dollars just to return kickoffs and punts, where one team drop kicks the ball to the other team. While field goals may still count for offensive points, the kicker, holder and long-snapper [all part of the kicking team] are all special teams players.</p>

									<p>The defense's main job is to stop the offense from scoring. Defenses consist of:<br>
									-Two cornerbacks, responsible for defending wide recievers<br>
									-Two safeties, responsible for defending tight ends or the running back<br>
									-Three linebackers [An outside, inside and middle linebacker], who play a variety of roles, which include leading the defense, rushing the quarterback, defending tight ends and defending running backs<br>
									-Four defensive lineman, responsible for defending the running back and rushing the quarterback<br><br>

									Like the offense, the defense comes out with many more formations than the one listed above. In addition, defensive players usually do more different things than offensive players, in part because defensive schemes are so diverse and various. Defenses can stop the offense from scoring in multiple ways. They can stop the offense on third down and force a punt, stop them on fourth down and force a downs turnover. In addition, they can intercept an opposing quarterback's pass or knock the ball lose while an offensive player is running to force a fumble. If they recover the fumble, it becomes an offensive turnover. </p>
