									<p>Football offense may seem complicated to an outsider, and while it can be infinitesimally complex at times, the basic concepts are quite simple to understand. An offense's ultimate goal is almost always to score (or run out the clock). The offense can either choose to run the football along the ground or pass it through the air.</p>
									<p>The offense has five "skill" position players on the field at one time. These five players are eligible to go down the field and catch passes. These skill players are either tight ends, wide recievers, halfbacks or fullbacks. The formation an offense in is reffered to by two numbers. The first is the number of halfbacks/fullbacks and the second is the number of tight ends. So a 12 formation would be a one back, two tight end formation. Halfbacks are mainly used as the back who gets the handoff and also blocks in pass protection. Some are formidable pass-catchers as well. A fullback is used in both run and pass blocking, but the best are used in tough short yardage situations. The tight end is a large pass-catcher, but will also be use in run and pass blocking. Finally, the wide recievers will have a role in run-blocking, <br>but their main job is to go down the field and catch passes.<p>
									<p>A running offense is more likely to be run by a team with a weaker defense, attempting to run more time off the clock to keep the opposing offense off of the field. There are a few basic runs. An up the middle run is attempting to capitalise on a small hole created by the offensive line. Sometimes the halfback will follow the fullback up this hole, while other times it will go through by themselves. Another run is the sweep or toss play. A designed run to the outside of the defensive line in attempt to gain more yards. This play is often a higher risk play though, as if a defensive player reads the play well they will be able to get a tackle for a loss of yards and even force a fumble. A final basic run play is the draw play, where the quarterback pretends to drop back into a passing play but then hands the ball off, which baits the defense to move back and then allows the halfback to get to the hole.<p>
									<p>A passing offense allows for a faster attack, especially because the clock stops with every incompletion. With a smart and capable quarterback, a team's passing attack can flourish. In a passing attack, the offensive line is essential. They must keep the opposing defense from being able to put pressure on the quarterback, or a team's passing attack is doomed. Almost all routes that recievers run are based on the route tree. Numbered 0-9, the route tree is used on all levels of football. Short passes are essential to beat a blitizing defense and make up for offensive line mistakes. They may not pick up a lot of yards, but enable the quarterback to get the ball out quickly and make steady progress. If the offense is really having trouble protecting their quarterback, the quarterback might take the snap in the shotgun position. This is where the quarterback takes a few steps back and then recieves the snap farther away from the line of scrimmage. Deep routes help stretch the field and successful deep routes can create more space underneath to run the ball the next few plays. Big play recievers are a must-have to be successful on offense. Two other passes are the screen and play action. A screen pass has the entire offensive line drop and allow the defense to come through. The quarterback just throws a little pass over to a wide reciever or running back and then the offensive line will come up and block for the reciever. The play action involves faking a handoff and then throwing the ball, which makes defenders bite on the run fake and open up more passes down the field.<p>
